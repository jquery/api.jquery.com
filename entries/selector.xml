      <p>Note: This API has been removed in jQuery 3.0. The property was never a reliable indicator of the selector that could be used to obtain the set of elements currently contained in the jQuery set where it was a property, since subsequent traversal methods may have changed the set. Plugins that need to use a selector string within their plugin can require it as a parameter of the method. For example, a "foo" plugin could be written as <code>$.fn.foo = function( selector, options ) { /* plugin code goes here */ };</code>, and the person using the plugin would write <code>$( "div.bar" ).foo( "div.bar", {dog: "bark"} );</code> with the <code>"div.bar"</code> selector repeated as the first argument of <code>.foo()</code>.</p>

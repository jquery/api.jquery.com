  <desc>A selector representing selector passed to jQuery(), if any, when creating the original set.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>The <code>.selector</code> property was deprecated in jQuery 1.7 and is only maintained to the extent needed for supporting <code>.live()</code> in the jQuery Migrate plugin. It may be removed without notice in a future version. The property was never a reliable indicator of the selector that could be used to obtain the set of elements currently contained in the jQuery set where it was a property, since subsequent traversal methods may have changed the set. Plugins that need to use a selector should have the caller pass in the selector as part of the plugin's arguments during initialization.</p>

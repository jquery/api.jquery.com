    <desc> Determine whether a Deferred object has been resolved. </desc>
    <longdesc> 
<p>As of jQuery 1.7 this API has been deprecated; please use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.state"><code>deferred.state()</code></a> instead.</p>
<p>Returns <code>true</code> if the Deferred object is in the resolved state, meaning that either <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolve/"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolveWith/"><code>deferred.resolveWith()</code></a> has been called for the object and the doneCallbacks have been called (or are in the process of being called).</p>
<p>Note that a Deferred object can be in one of three states: pending, resolved, or rejected; use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.isRejected/"><code>deferred.isRejected()</code></a> to determine whether the Deferred object is in the rejected state. These methods are primarily useful for debugging, for example to determine whether a Deferred has already been resolved even though you are inside code that intended to reject it.</p>  </longdesc>

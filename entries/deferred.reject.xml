  <desc> Reject a Deferred object and call any failCallbacks with the given <code>args</code>. </desc>
  <longdesc> <p>Normally, only the creator of a Deferred should call this method; you can prevent other code from changing the Deferred's state by returning a restricted Promise object through <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.promise/"><code>deferred.promise()</code></a>.</p>
  <p>When the Deferred is rejected, any failCallbacks added by <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then/"><code>deferred.then</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail/"><code>deferred.fail</code></a> are called. Callbacks are executed in the order they were added. Each callback is passed the <code>args</code> from the <code>deferred.reject()</code> call. Any failCallbacks added after the Deferred enters the rejected state are executed immediately when they are added, using the arguments that were passed to the <code>.reject()</code> call. For more information, see the documentation for <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a>.</p>  </longdesc>

  <desc>The difference in milliseconds between the time the browser created the event and January 1, 1970.</desc>
  <longdesc>
    <p>This property can be useful for profiling event performance by getting the <code>event.timeStamp</code> value at two points in the code and noting the difference. To simply determine the current time inside an event handler, use <code>(new Date).getTime()</code> instead.</p>
    <p>Note: Due to a <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=238041">bug open since 2004</a>, this value is not populated correctly in Firefox and it is not possible to know the time the event was created in that browser.</p>

    <desc>Display the time since the click handler last executed.</desc>

        Optional additional functions, or arrays of functions, that are called when the Deferred is resolved or rejected.

    <p>The argument can be either a single function or an array of functions. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, the <code>alwaysCallbacks</code> are called. Since <code>deferred.always()</code> returns the Deferred object, other methods of the Deferred object can be chained to this one, including additional <code>.always()</code> methods. When the Deferred is resolved or rejected, callbacks are executed in the order they were added, using the arguments provided to the <a href="/deferred.resolve/"><code>resolve</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.reject/"><code>reject</code></a>, <a href="/deferred.resolveWith/"><code>resolveWith</code></a> or <a href="/deferred.rejectWith/"><code>rejectWith</code></a> method calls. For more information, see the documentation for <a href="/category/deferred-object/">Deferred object</a>.</p>
  </longdesc>
  <example>
    <desc>Since the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/"><code>jQuery.get()</code></a> method returns a <code>jqXHR</code> object, which is derived from a Deferred object, we can attach a callback for both success and error using the <code>deferred.always()</code> method.</desc>
    <code><![CDATA[
$.get( "test.php" ).always(function() {
  alert( "$.get completed with success or error callback arguments" );
});
]]></code>

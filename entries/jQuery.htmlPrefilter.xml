    <p>This method rarely needs to be called directly. Instead, use it as an entry point to modify existing <a href="/category/manipulation/">jQuery manipulation methods</a>. jQuery calls this method on input HTML before processing it further: it accepts an HTML string &amp; should return a HTML string as well.</p>
    <p>This function can also be overwritten in order to bypass certain edge case issues. The default <code>htmlPrefilter</code> function in jQuery leaves input unmodified since 3.5.0. Older versions would greedily ensure that all tags were XHTML-compliant. This included anything that looked like an HTML tag, but was actually within a string (e.g. <code>&lt;a title="&lt;div /&gt;"&gt;&lt;&gt;</code>), leading to potential security issues.

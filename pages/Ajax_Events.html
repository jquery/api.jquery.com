<p>Ajax requests produce a number of different events that you can subscribe to. Here's a full list of the events and in what order they are triggered.</p>
<p>There are two types of events:</p>
<h3>Local Events</h3>
<p>These are callbacks that you can subscribe to within the Ajax request object, like so:</p>
<pre><code> $.ajax({
   beforeSend: function(){
     // Handle the beforeSend event
   },
   complete: function(){
     // Handle the complete event
   }
   // ......
 });
</code></pre>
<h3>Global Events</h3>
<p>These events are triggered on the <code>document</code>, calling any handlers which may be listening. You can listen for these events like so:</p>
<pre> $(document).bind("ajaxSend", function(){
   $("#loading").show();
 }).bind("ajaxComplete", function(){
   $("#loading").hide();
 });
</pre>
<p>Global events can be disabled for a particular Ajax request by passing in the global option, like so:</p>
<pre><code> $.ajax({
   url: "test.html",
   global: false,
   // ...
 });
</code></pre>
<h3>Events</h3>
<p>This is the full list of Ajax events, and in the order in which they are triggered. The indented events are triggered for each and every Ajax request (unless a global option has been set). The ajaxStart and ajaxStop events are events that relate to all Ajax requests together.
</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>ajaxStart</b> (Global Event)<br>This event is triggered if an Ajax request is started and no other Ajax requests are currently running.
    <ul>
      <li> <b>beforeSend</b> (Local Event)<br>This event, which is triggered before an Ajax request is started, allows you to modify the XMLHttpRequest object (setting additional headers, if need be.)</li>
      <li> <b>ajaxSend</b> (Global Event)<br>This global event is also triggered before the request is run.</li>
      <li> <b>success</b> (Local Event)<br>This event is only called if the request was successful (no errors from the server, no errors with the data).</li>
      <li> <b>ajaxSuccess</b> (Global Event)<br>This event is also only called if the request was successful.</li>
      <li> <b>error</b> (Local Event)<br>This event is only called if an error occurred with the request (you can never have both an error and a success callback with a request).</li>
      <li> <b>ajaxError</b> (Global Event)<br>This global event behaves the same as the local error event.</li>
      <li> <b>complete</b> (Local Event)<br>This event is called regardless of if the request was successful, or not. You will always receive a complete callback, even for synchronous requests.</li>
      <li> <b>ajaxComplete</b> (Global Event)<br>This event behaves the same as the complete event and will be triggered every time an Ajax request finishes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><b>ajaxStop</b> (Global Event)<br>This global event is triggered if there are no more Ajax requests being processed.</li>
</ul>

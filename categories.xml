	<category name="Deferred Object" slug="deferred-object">
		<desc>
			<p><code>jQuery.Deferred()</code>, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.</p>
			<div class="longdesc">
				<p>In JavaScript it is common to invoke functions that optionally accept callbacks that are called within that function.</p>
				<p>For example, in versions prior to jQuery 1.5, asynchronous processes such as <code>jQuery.ajax()</code> accept callbacks to be invoked some time in the near-future upon success, error, and completion of the ajax request.</p>
				<p><code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> introduces several enhancements to the way callbacks are managed and invoked. In particular, <code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> provides flexible ways to provide multiple callbacks, and these callbacks can be invoked regardless of whether the original callback dispatch has already occurred. jQuery Deferred is based on the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A">CommonJS Promises/A</a> design.</p>
				<p>One model for understanding Deferred is to think of it as a chain-aware function wrapper. The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> methods specify the functions to be called and the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolve"><code>deferred.resolve(args)</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.reject"><code>deferred.reject(args)</code></a> methods "call" the functions with the arguments you supply. Once the Deferred has been resolved or rejected it stays in that state; a second call to <code>deferred.resolve()</code> is ignored for example. If more functions are added by <code>deferred.then()</code> after the Deferred is resolved, they are called immediately with the arguments previously provided.</p>
				<p>In most cases where a jQuery API call returns a Deferred or Deferred-compatible object, such as <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax"><code>jQuery.ajax()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when"><code>jQuery.when()</code></a>, you will only want to use the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, and <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> methods to add callbacks to the Deferred's queues. The internals of the API call or code that created the Deferred will invoke <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolve"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.reject"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> on the deferred at some point, causing the appropriate callbacks to run.</p>
				<h4>jQuery.Deferred Constructor</h4>
				<p>The <code>jQuery.Deferred()</code> constructor creates a new Deferred object. The <code>new</code> operator is optional.</p>
				<p><code>jQuery.Deferred</code> can be passed an optional function, which is called just before the constructor returns and is passed the constructed <code>deferred</code> object as both the <code>this</code> object and as the first argument to the function. The called function can attach callbacks using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then"><code>deferred.then()</code></a> for example.</p>
				<p>A Deferred object starts in the <em>pending</em> state. Any callbacks added to the object with <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.then"><code>deferred.then()</code></a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done"><code>deferred.done()</code></a>, or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.fail"><code>deferred.fail()</code></a> are queued to be executed later. Calling <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolve"><code>deferred.resolve()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.resolveWith"><code>deferred.resolveWith()</code></a> transitions the Deferred into the <em>resolved</em> state and immediately executes any <code>doneCallbacks</code> that are set. Calling <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.reject"><code>deferred.reject()</code></a> or <a href="http://api.jquery.com/deferred.rejectWith"><code>deferred.rejectWith()</code></a> transitions the Deferred into the <em>rejected</em> state and immediately executes any <code>failCallbacks</code> that are set. Once the object has entered the resolved or rejected state, it stays in that state. Callbacks can still be added to the resolved or rejected Deferred -- they will execute immediately.</p>
				<p>The Deferred object is chainable, similar to the way a jQuery object is chainable, but it has its own methods. After creating a Deferred object, you can use any of the methods below by either chaining directly from the object creation or saving the object in a variable and invoking one or more methods on that variable.</p>

				<p>jQuery's event system normalizes the event object according to <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2003/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20030331/ecma-script-binding.html">W3C standards</a>. The event object is guaranteed to be passed to the event handler. Most properties from the original event are copied over and normalized to the new event object.</p>
				<div class="longdesc">
					<h4>jQuery.Event Constructor</h4>
					<p>The <code>jQuery.Event</code> constructor is exposed and can be used when calling <a href="/trigger">trigger</a>. The <code>new</code> operator is optional.</p>
					<p>Check <a href="/trigger">trigger</a>'s documentation to see how to combine it with your own event object.</p>
					<p>Example:</p>
					<pre><code><![CDATA[  //Create a new jQuery.Event object without the "new" operator.
  var e = jQuery.Event("click");
  
  // trigger an artificial click event
  jQuery("body").trigger( e );
]]></code></pre>
					<p>As of jQuery 1.6, you can also pass an object to <code>jQuery.Event()</code> and its properties will be set on the newly created Event object.</p>
					<p>Example:</p>
					<pre><code><![CDATA[  // Create a new jQuery.Event object with specified event properties.
  var e = jQuery.Event("keydown", { keyCode: 64 });
  
  // trigger an artificial keydown event with keyCode 64
  jQuery("body").trigger( e );
]]></code></pre>
					<h4>Event Properties</h4>
					<p>jQuery normalizes the following properties for cross-browser consistency:</p>
					<ul>
					<li><code>target</code></li>
					<li><code>relatedTarget</code></li>
					<li><code>pageX</code></li>
					<li><code>pageY</code></li>
					<li><code>which</code></li>
					<li><code>metaKey</code></li>
					</ul>
					<p>The following properties are also copied to the event object, though some of their values may be undefined depending on the event:</p>
					<p>altKey, bubbles, button, cancelable, charCode, clientX, clientY, ctrlKey, currentTarget, data, detail, eventPhase, metaKey, offsetX, offsetY, originalTarget, pageX, pageY, prevValue, relatedTarget, screenX, screenY, shiftKey, target, view, which</p>
					<h4>OtherProperties</h4>
					<p>Certain events may have properties specific to them. Those can be accessed as properties of the <code>event.originalEvent</code> object. To make special properties available in all event objects, they can be added to the <code>jQuery.event.props</code> array. This is not recommended, since it adds overhead to every event delivered by jQuery.</p>
					<p>Example:</p>
					<pre><code><![CDATA[
  // add the dataTransfer property for use with the native `drop` event
  // to capture information about files dropped into the browser window
  jQuery.event.props.push("dataTransfer");
]]></code></pre>

		<desc>
			<p>Borrowing from CSS 1–3, and then adding its own, jQuery offers a powerful set of tools for matching a set of elements in a document.</p>
			<p>If you wish to use any of the meta-characters ( such as <code> !&quot;#$%&amp;&#39;()*+,./:;&lt;=&gt;?@[\]^`{|}~</code> ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: <code>\\</code>. For example, if you have an element with <code>id="foo.bar"</code>, you can use the selector <code>$("#foo\\.bar")</code>. The W3C CSS specification contains the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier">complete set of rules regarding valid CSS selectors</a>. Also useful is the blog entry by Mathias Bynens on <a href="http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes">CSS character escape sequences for identifiers</a>.</p>
		</desc>
		<category name="Attribute" slug="attribute-selectors">
			<desc>
				<p>The CSS specification also allows elements to be identified by their attributes. While not widely supported by browsers for the purpose of styling documents, these attribute selectors are highly useful, and jQuery allows us to employ them regardless of the browser being used.
				When using any of the following attribute selectors, we should account for attributes that have multiple, space-separated values. Since these selectors see attribute values as a single string, this selector, for example, <code>$("a[rel='nofollow']")</code>, will select <code><a href="example.html" rel="nofollow">Some text</a></code> but not <code><a href="example.html">Some text</a></code>.</p>
				<p>Attribute values in selector expressions <b>must</b> follow the rules for W3C CSS selectors, in general that means anything other than a simple identifier should be surrounded by quotation marks.</p>
				<ul>
				<li>double quotes inside single quotes: <code>$('a[rel="nofollow self"]')</code></li>
				<li>single quotes inside double quotes: <code>$("a[rel='nofollow self']")</code></li>
				<li>escaped single quotes inside single quotes: <code>$('a[rel=\'nofollow self\']')</code></li>
				<li>escaped double quotes inside double quotes: <code>$("a[rel=\"nofollow self\"]")</code></li>
				</ul>
				<p>The variation you choose is generally a matter of style or convenience.</p>

				<p><strong>Note</strong>: In jQuery 1.3 <code>[@attr]</code> style selectors were removed (they were previously deprecated in jQuery 1.2). Simply remove the "@" symbol from your selectors in order to make them work again.</p>
